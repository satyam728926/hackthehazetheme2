# Project Thoughts & Reflections

## Approach & Logic
Implemented a simple scraper that fetches HTML content and extracts image URLs using Cheerio. Frontend built in React with input validation and graceful error handling.

## Challenges & Solutions
Handled relative vs absolute image URLs, managed async scraping across multiple URLs, and added user-friendly loading and error states.

## Future Improvements
- Add pagination for large image sets
- Enhance URL validation and error reporting
- Implement caching to reduce repeated scraping
- Improve UI/UX with better styling and animations
